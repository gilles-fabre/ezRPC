ezRPC is a simple yet hopefully efficient RPC library for both Linux and Windows. 
RPC calls are currently transported over AF_UNIX (Linux only) or AF_INET tcp 
connections, but by deriving and specializing the Transport and Link classes, 
it is possible to use about any other connected transport/IPC. 

To build the project run cmake at the ezRPC directory, then navigate to the cmake build
directory you've set and run make/make install. The bin directory under the ezRPC 
directory shall contain everything you need to start playing with ezRPC.

By default, some traces are generated that are automatically sent to a viewer tool 
located in the ezRPC/LogReporter tool. 

ezRPC doesn't require to use an IDL language/compiler to generate RPC code or messages, 
it is fast and very simple to use.

Just have a look at the ezRPC/RPC/Test code to see how to implement an RPC client or 
server in a few lines of code.

ezRPC comes under the MIT license so feel free to use, modify it and distribute free 
of charge in compliance with the MIT licence.

NEW as of V2 : JSon RPC is supported, and C#/C++ client and servers can now interop through a
dedicated Json RPC Wrapper (see ezRPC_CSharpTestClient/Server).

A bunch of Unit Tests have been added (Windows only -native visual studio tests-) in addition 
to all the test client/servers.

NOTE : the StateMachine related code is Linux only, it implements a StateMachine 
server, built upon the RPC mechanism, making it possible to load a state Machine, 
instantiated from a json definition, and calling back into the give rpc server 
callbacks upon state changes (or timeouts). This is just experimental, so it most likely 
requires a bunch of extra work.

Have fun,
