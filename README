ezRPC is a simple yet hopefully efficient RPC library. RPC calls are currently transported over AF_UNIX or AF_INET tcp connections, but by deriving and specializing the Transport and Link classes, it should possible to use about any other connected transport/IPC. ezRPC is LGPL so feel free to use, modify it and distribute free of charge in compliance with the MIT licence.

To compile ezRPC, get into the root dir and just type "make", to build the test/example programs for the Transport or RPC, get into the corresponding sub directory and type "make -f Makefile.test rebuild".

Have fun,
