ezRPC is a simple yet hopefully efficient RPC library. RPC calls are currently 
transported over AF_UNIX or AF_INET tcp connections, but by deriving and 
specializing the Transport and Link classes, it should possible to use 
about any other connected transport/IPC. ezRPC comes under the MIT license so 
feel free to use, modify it and distribute free of charge in compliance with 
the MIT licence.

Have fun,
